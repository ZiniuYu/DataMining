Chapter 1 Data Matrix
=====================

1.1 Data Matrix
---------------

The :math:`n\times d` data matrix is given as

.. math::

    \D=\bb &X_1&X_2&\cds&X_d\\ \x_1&x_{11}&x_{12}&\cds&x_{1d}\\
    \x_2&x_{21}&x_{22}&\cds&x_{2d}\\ \vds&\vds&\vds&\dds&\vds\\
    \x_n&x_{n1}&x_{n2}&\cds&x_{nd} \eb

where :math:`\x_i` donotes the :math:`i`\ th row, which is a :math:`d`-tuple given as

.. math::

    \x_i=(x_{i1},x_{i2},\cds,x_{id})

and :math:`X_j` denotes the :math:`j`\ th column, which is an :math:`n`-tuple given as

.. math::

    X_j=(x_{1j},x_{2j},\cds,x_{nj})

The number of instances :math:`n` is referred to as the *size* of the data, 
whereas the number of attributes :math:`d` is called the *dimensionality* of the
data.

1.2 Attributes
--------------

**Numeric Attributes**

A *numeric* attribute is one that has a real-valued or integer-valued domain.
Numeric attributes that take on a finite or countably infinite set of values are 
called *discrete*, whereas those that can take on any real value are called
*continuous*.
If an attribute has as its domain the set :math:`\{0, 1\}`, it is called a *binary* attribute.

* *Interval-scaled*: For these kinds of attributes only differences (addtion or subtraction) make sense.

* *Ratio-scaled*: Here one can compute both differences as well as ratios between values.

**Categorical Attributes**

A *categorical* attribute is one that has a set-valued domain composed of a set of symbols.

* *Nominal*: The attribute values in the domain are unordered, and thus only equality comparisons are meaningful.

* *Ordinal*: The attribute values are ordered, and thus both equality 
  comparisons and inequality comparisons are allowed, though it may not be 
  possible to quantify the difference between values.

1.3 Data: Algebraic and Geometric View
--------------------------------------

If the :math:`d` attributes or dimensions in the data matrix :math:`\D` are all numeric, then each row can be considered as a :math:`d`-dimensional point:
