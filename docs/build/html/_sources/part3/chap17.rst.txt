Chapter 17 Clustering Validation
================================

Cluster validation and assessment encompasses three main tasks: *clustering*
*evaluation* seeks to asses the goodness or quality of the clustering,
*clustering stability* seeks to understand the sensitivity of the clustering
result to various algorithmic parameters, and *clustering tendency* assesses the
suitability of applying clustering in the first place.

**External**: external validation measures employ criteria that are not inherent to the dataset.

**Internal**: Internal validation measures employ critieria that are derived from the data itself.

**Relative**: Relative validation measures aim to directly compare different 
clusterings, usually those obtained via different parameter settings for the 
same algorithm.
